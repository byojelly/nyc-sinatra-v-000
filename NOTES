1)  view pages for all of the landmarks and a user will be able to create a new landmark.


In new / edit
    create or checkbox Landmark
    create or checkbox title

BUT, when a user creates or edits a figure, they should also be able to select or create a new landmark and/or title to associate to that figure. In other words, the form for a new figure and the form to edit a figure should allow the user to select from existing landmarks and title and create new landmarks and titles to associate to the figure.

Our client doesn't really care about titles, on the other hand, and we won't be required to build a titles controller or to have any titles views.

New titles will only get created in the context of creating or editing a figure.

Any time you have a has_many to has_many relationship, you'll need to create a join table. An example of a has_many to has_many relationship is titles and figures. A title has_many figures because many people hold a title over time and a figure usually has_many titles over their career.

Your forms will need to be complex.

1)Your form for a new figure should dynamically generate checkboxes out of the available landmarks and titles.

2) It should also have fields for creating a new landmark and/or a new title.

3)The controller action that catches the POST request sent by submitting this form should account for this. The same is true of your form for editing a given figure. Read the tests very carefully to understand how you should set up your forms.
